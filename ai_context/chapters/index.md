Deliverables Provided:
✅ ER Diagrams - Comprehensive Mermaid erDiagram blocks for each system using snake_case conventions
✅ Gameplay Flowcharts - Detailed Mermaid flowchart TD blocks showing combat and system processes
✅ TypeScript Enums & Constants - Complete enum definitions and constants for all game systems
✅ Explanatory Notes - Concise bullet-point clarifications for each system's mechanics

The specification models all game systems except quests as requested, with particular focus on standard battle gameplay logic (initiative → turn loop → resolution, including edge cases). All diagrams follow Convex conventions with implicit _id and _creation_time fields, use proper foreign-key relationships, and maintain consistent snake_case naming throughout.

The data model is now ready for implementation - the next step would be data extraction from the PDF to populate the schema, which you mentioned will be handled separately.
